Plan:
- Create data classes for exception types, and attach explanation templates to them
- Create json object representations of a record for the records in exceptions; this needs its own function
- Clean data
    Phase 1:
    - Put all cancelled trades in exceptions
    - Put all trades with INVALID_SYM in exceptions
    - Timestamps
        - Put all trades with no timestamp in exceptions
        - Then, format all timestamps the same (ISO 8601 string)
    - Finally, check if they don't have a price/quantity and put in exceptions
    - Round all prices to two decimal points
    
    Phase 2:
    -

- pandasql for detecting and flagging discrepancies
- pandas.to_json() for exporting the final files
